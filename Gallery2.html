<figcaption><h1>Shrodingers Cat</h1>2022, Installation <p>Artist Statement; What are the limitations of our interaction with space? Does the manner of movement within a space have an exclusive outcome? Would your life be different if the subatomic particles in space were disrupted in a different manner?
  Inspiried by quantum mechanics and mysticism, ‘Shrodengers Cat’ (2022) is a ‘fotune teller’ that teathers your physical movement in space to a potential outcome in reality, exploring the limitiations of your current lived experience and the potential for alternate lived outcomes.</p></figcaption>

<p>Artist Statement; If an idea is actualized in reality, could u consider it to be a print of the original thought? ‘An artistic process based on the principle of transferring images from a matrix onto another surface e.g. AIR’ is a 3D print work that uses balloon art as a form of printmaking. The balloon is activated by breath and printed onto air from instructions that act as the matrix. The work attempts to subvert the conventions of printmaking by reimagining the print matrix as potentially immaterial and defining it as something that can exist solely in the mind. Challenging the widely accepted materiality of printmaking and the idea of a ‘Matrix’ by highlighting the potential of immaterial forms in a modern printmaking practice.

  <p>Artist Statement;‘Helixileh, a Compass of Moral’ is a handbound artist book featuring 21 handprinted linoleum stamps. The piece explores the game of Helixileh. Invented by David Beler, Helixileh is a form of mind map designed to illuminate the interconnectedness of all things. To play the game, you write a word at the centre of the Flower of Life and a related word at all the adjacent vertices, infinitely expanding outwards with related words you never realised were connected. By using text and sacred geometry, the work highlights how the interconnectedness of all things does not end with external stimuli but extends back into our moral and rational judgement and day to day thought. The book functions as a tool in ritual through the strategically designed ‘board game style’ back cover, allowing the beholder to expand their thoughts through the act of playing Helixileh. In addition, the personal religious text within the pages acts as a moral compass/mirror to the soul in times of confusion. Thus, creating an integral religious artefact.</p>
